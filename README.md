### You've just found a new friend!
one brown kiwi bird (*Apteryx*) in the hand, is the same as roughly **sixteen** of the fruit of the same name (*Actinidia deliciosa*)   
*huh, isn't that neat.*

Hi there, I'm Shaunak Ghosh, a python developer who enjoys euler problems and occasional web design.

Some things i've made:
- ðŸŒ„ [CSIMV](https://github.com/shoe-77/CSIMV-Image-Generator), an Image Generator powered by maths
- ðŸŽ¹ [chords](https://github.com/shoe-77/chords), a little mac utility based on Louie Zong's *dream piano*
- ðŸš¨ [Stylize](https://github.com/shoe-77/Stylize), a nifty little html plugin (doesn't do much though, only a few things)
- Aaaand that's it! There's more tiny things at my code-0 series of repos

I'm currently working on my Github website (pages), which will be hosting all my stupid little web antics
Also working on a programmer's rubber duck trained on Adlerian psychology (stupid little thing)

*cough*  
Thats it!
